# Maths

Without math, computer vision wouldn't exist. Though it may not be used to
directly process the images, it forms the heart of the processing pipeline. It 
comes in many shapes and sizes, depending on the use case and efficiency of the
operations; for instance, trigonometry is useful for mid-level processes, but 
basic geometry is sufficient for a lot of use cases (described briefly in 
[Introduction to Pinholes](/cameras/intro_to_pinholes.md)). Eventually, we'll 
have articles on everything from simple geometry to linear algebra, but for now
we'll start with beginning trigonometry.
