## What is Computer Vision?
Computer vision is the technology that allows computers to analyze, interpret,
and understand visuals like humans do. It can involve various tasks ranging
from spotting a saturated object to determining where something is in its
environment. Computers complete these tasks by using [Cameras](cameras/index.md),
processing their inputs frame by frame with some algorithm to achieve the deisired
result.

Within these docs we will teach you how to implement things that we determine to
be valuable within the scope of FIRST Robotics. [More information on our roadmap](meta/version.md)

## What You Need
To get started, we recommend a USB camera (anything around 720p or above will do), 
and a computer with python 3, pip, and an IDE of your choice to write it in. We 
recommend using [VSCode :icon-link-external:](https://code.visualstudio.com/){target="_blank"} if you are a beginner; 
it has a great plugin for python and a large community around it.
