# The Green Alliance

## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide beginner-friendly, easy-to-implement documentation 
and articles to help you implement hand written vision into your FIRST team's 
robot.

## What You Need
To get started, we reccomend a webcam (anything around 720p or above will do), 
and a computer with python 3, pip, and an IDE of your choice to write it in. We 
recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) if you are a beginner; 
it has a great plugin for python and a large community around it.
