# Cameras

Cameras are the foundation of computer vision; without them, we wouldn't have 
images to process in the first place. Needless to say, at least a basic 
understanding is essential for working with vision code; thankfully, they're 
not as complicated as it seems. 

## Establishing the Type
There are a couple of types of cameras, the main two that we'll focus on are
fisheyes and pinholes. Generally, if your thinking of a camera, it's a pinhole.
Fisheyes are a lot more complicated, and involve a heap of extra work before
they can be processed with computer vision. For most computer vision purposes,
especially in FRC robotics, pinhole cameras will be sufficient, and so that's 
what our articles will go in depth on.
