# Raspberry Pis
The computer that most people use for vision in FRC is the Raspberry Pi, due to their ease of use, compact size, and relatively low price tag. Even though they may not have the greatest of processing power, they do well enough to be able to run computer vision for a robot! When setting up a pi, most will install the default Raspberry Pi operating system, a special flavour of Debian optimised for the Pi.
