# What is OpenCV?
OpenCV (Computer Vision) is a programming library that can help us achieve
our goals when it comes to computer vision. As the name says, OpenCV
is fully open source, and it handles much of the base level work with
vision, including various aspects of image processing.

## How to Use
OpenCV has great documentation on all of its various functions and features,
however, we obviously can't cover all of them in these docs. We will try to
cover all of the important snippets when we need them, but if you want to go 
more in-depth, you can find their documentation in
[the OpenCV docs](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html/).
``` py
import cv2
```
There is no need to go looking too far into the docs, as we will show how
to program any concepts we mention, but don't be afraid to look.
