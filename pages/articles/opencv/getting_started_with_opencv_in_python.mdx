**<u>Setup</u>**
As with most other python libraries, the first thing you'll need to do is install the libary using pip. If you dont have pip, you can get it by downloading [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), navigating to the folder where it is stored, and running `python get-pip.py`

To install OpenCV, open up the command line and type in `pip install opencv-python`. This will give you two libraries, OpenCV and numpy, the latter of which will be used later.

Now that you have the library installed, you can import it just like any other library using an import statement at the top of your file
```py
import cv2
```

Thats all you have to do, like other pip libraries its just install, and import.
