**<u>The While Loop</u>**
To begin, we need a loop that is going to run continously, so that our program is running until we want it to stop.

To do this, we make use of a continously running loop using while. But we dont want it to get stuck forever, so we also will use a special if statement at the bottom of the program to break out of that loop.

```py
import cv2
while True:
	
```

In this case, we have a few variables. The first is `cap`, which is a videocapture using the given cv2 function. From this we move into the `while True:` loop and use a `.read()` method to get two variables. `ret` represents the success of the videocapture function in getting a source from the camera specified in its parameter, so it should in theory always be true. If its not then you have a problem. 
>Syntax Note
>>Cameras in OpenCV are represented by number id's. Much like other id systems in programming the first number is 0, so if you are for example working on a laptop, the default webcam will be 0, and any webcams you plug in from there will be 1,2,3 and so on.

The variable we care about is `img`, as this is the video output we will be using throughout the rest of our program. To display this video output on our screen, we use the `.imshow()` method which takes two parameters, those being a string for the name of the window, and the `mat` which is what we are displaying, so we use the `img` variable since we're displaying that video source. 

```py
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while True:
    ret,img = cap.read()
    cv2.imshow("Image",img)
```

The final part of the skeleton of our program here is how we're going to get out of that ever-running loop. To do this we use the `waitKey()` function given a parameter `delay` in milliseconds, and check if it is equal to a certain key, which we access with the `ord()` function and use a string for whatever character we want to be our exit button, common buttons are q, \b for backspace, and \u for escape. Now when our window opens, we can quit out of it using the designated key.

```py
import cv2
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
while True:
    ret,img = cap.read()
    cv2.imshow("Image",img)
	if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
		break
```

Now we have a window that shows the video from your camera. From there, a majority of what we do can be graphically represented by drawing over this video.
