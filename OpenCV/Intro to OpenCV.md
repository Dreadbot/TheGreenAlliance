# OpenCV
**<u>What is OpenCV?</u>**
OpenCV (short for Open Computer Vision) is a *Python*, *C++*, *Java* and *MATLAB* library developed by *intel* in 2000. While not nearly the same libary it was back then, the goal of the libary remains the same, to provide real-time computer vision and machine learning functions to its users.
**<u>Why do we care?</u>**
OpenCV is used by FIRST teams across the globe, to allow for easy and efficient targeting, game element finding, and generally speeding up things that the drivers would otherwise have to do costing them precious seconds. We at the dreadbots have been using OpenCV for many years as of the 2021-2022 season, written completely in-house by students.
**<u>What language should I use?</u>**
While we use *Python*, if you are more experienced in one of the other languages such as *Java* it can be easier to use that instead. Python is liked for its ease of readability and beginner friendly style meaning it can be read by the newer students coming into your programming teams. It should be noted that here, since we use Python, these articles will also be written for OpenCV in Python.
**<u>How hard is OpenCV?</u>**
OpenCV can be as easy or difficult as you need it to be. A simple target finder can be as small as a few dozen lines while driving a turret (as seen on the Dreadbot 2022 bot) can be hundreds of lines. In general though, with a basic understanding of the language you're working in, OpenCV can be very easy to pick up on for new users, and only requires a high school level understanding to really put into practice on your bot.
