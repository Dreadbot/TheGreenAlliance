# AprilTags

## What are AprilTags?
An Apriltag is a fiducial marker used for a variety of tasks, ranging from
[camera calibration](/implementation/cameracal.md) to
[localization](/implementation/localization.md). AprilTags are all around the
field, whether you are in FRC or FTC.
!!!
While the term **fudicial** might sound scary, it just
means that the tag has a known fixed position, serving
as a point of comparison. This means whenever an AprilTag
is seen by a camera, the camera can figure out its position
relative to the tag.
