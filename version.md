## How to Contribute
If you would like to contribute to The Green Alliance and add an article, please open an issue on the [Github :icon-link-external:](https://github.com/Dreadbot/TheGreenAlliance){target="_blank"}, if one does not already exist for such an article. This way, you can communicate and collaborate with others while the article is in progress. If you would like to make an edit to an article, you can simply create a pull request with the change. Please remember that the Dreadbots have the final say for what goes on the site, but any and all relevant topics and contributions are welcome.

### How to Make Edits
The Green Alliance is powered by [Retype :icon-link-external:](https://retype.com){target="_blank"}, so please read their documentation to understand how it works. You can clone the repository and make local changes using retype, and after making your edits, open a pull request on the [Github :icon-link-external:](https://github.com/Dreadbot/TheGreenAlliance){target="_blank"}. If you are an author of a page, please make sure the page is configured as such (If you would like to be credited).

### Standardized Rules and Guidelines
Before writing an article, please make sure you are adhering to the following rules and guidelines.
==- 1. Keep it Vision
The Green Alliance is about vision for [FIRST Robotics :icon-link-external:](https://www.firstinspires.org/){target="_blank"}, so all articles on The Green Alliance must be at least tangentially related to computer vision in a FIRST setting.
==-
==- 2. Follow the Styling
Please try to stick to the format and styling seen on the site (Ex. All external links have this icon: :icon-link-external:, as well as open in a new tab). This will be edited when a page is added to the site, but it makes our job much easier.
==-
==- 3. This is a Community Resource
Please remember that everything that goes on this site is available to anyone. We will not make any pages exclusive in any way, or block any team from contributing. There is no "wrong solution" when it comes to vision, so anything goes.
==-
==- 4. Only Homebrew Vision
While there are systems (such as Limelight or PhotonVision) that do vision in FIRST, they have their own documentation and support and as such do not belong here. The Green Alliance is for people to learn and implement their own computer vision systems, and for teams to share and learn from eachothers vision solutions.
