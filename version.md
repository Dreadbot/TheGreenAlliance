# **v1.0.0** ɣ | Crescendo Update

This version of the site is Launch/pre-ɣ (pre-v1.0.0), released during the FIRST in Show
season and the Crescendo game (2024).

## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide beginner-friendly, easy-to-implement documentation 
and articles to help you implement hand written vision into your FIRST team's 
robot.

## Who We Are
We are the vision subteam from FRC team 3656,
[the Dexter Dreadbots :icon-link-external:](https://dexterdreadbots.org/){target="_blank"}.
Over time, new members will replace our old writers, and we plan on keeping this 
wiki upto date for as long as we still exist. We are always open to pull requests on
our [Github :icon-link-external:](https://github.com/Dreadbot/TheGreenAlliance){target="_blank"}
in case you would like to add an article. More information on contributing can be found there.
